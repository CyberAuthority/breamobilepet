# breamobilepet

This repository contains a simple static website for Brea Mobile Pet Grooming.
Upload the HTML files in the project root directly to your web host along with an `images` directory.

## Image Requirements
- `hero.jpg` (JPEG, 1600x900 px recommended)
- `service1.jpg` (JPEG, 800x600 px recommended)
- `service2.jpg` (JPEG, 800x600 px recommended)

Create an `images` folder beside the HTML files and place the images above in it.
Keep each file under 200 kB so pages load quickly.

After uploading `index.html`, `service1.html`, and `service2.html` together with `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, your site will be ready.
