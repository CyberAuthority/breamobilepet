This repository contains a simple static website for Brea Mobile Pet Grooming.
Upload the HTML files in the project root directly to your web host along with an `images` directory.

## Image Requirements
Place the following JPEG files inside an `images` folder next to the HTML files:
- `hero.jpg` – hero background image, 1600x900 px
- `service1.jpg` – dog grooming photo, 800x600 px
- `service2.jpg` – cat grooming photo, 800x600 px

Keep each file under 200 kB and use the exact names above so pages load correctly.
After uploading `index.html`, `service1.html`, and `service2.html` together with `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`, your site will be ready.
