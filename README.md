This repository contains a static website for **Brea Mobile Pet Grooming**. Upload the HTML files in the project root directly to your web host together with an `images` directory.

## Image Requirements
Add the following JPEG files inside an `images` folder next to the HTML files:

| File name | Recommended dimensions | Format |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| `hero.jpg` | 1600x900 px | JPEG |
| `service1.jpg` | 800x600 px | JPEG |
| `service2.jpg` | 800x600 px | JPEG |

Keep each file under **200&nbsp;kB** and use these exact names so pages load correctly.

After uploading `index.html`, `service1.html`, `service2.html`, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` together with your images, the site is ready to deploy.
