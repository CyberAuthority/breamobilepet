Static website for **Brea Mobile Pet Grooming** generated from `content.json`.

## Image Requirements
Place the following JPEG files in an `images` folder next to the HTML files:

| File name | Recommended dimensions | Format |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| `hero.jpg` | 1600x900 px | JPEG |
| `service1.jpg` | 800x600 px | JPEG |
| `service2.jpg` | 800x600 px | JPEG |

Keep each file under **200 kB** so pages load quickly.

## Deployment
Upload `index.html`, `service1.html`, `service2.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and the `images` directory to your web host. Each page includes a built-in contact form that posts to Formspree.
